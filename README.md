# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detector using Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet, and OpenCV. 


Applied real-time in Live Front Camera and detected 99.09% --With mask and 100%--Without mask 


This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes.
